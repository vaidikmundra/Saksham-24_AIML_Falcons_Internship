# The info() method is used in pandas to get a concise summary of a DataFrame. 
# This method is particularly including the number of non-null entries in each column, the data types of each column, and the memory usage of the DataFrame.

# Univariate analysis of the 'signal' column
# Load the 'fmri' dataset

# Bivariate analysis

# Understanding the "hue" Parameter-->
# The hue parameter is used to add a third dimension to the plot by coloring the data points based on the categories of a given column.
# This helps in distinguishing different groups within the data.


# Load the 'flights' dataset
flights = sns.load_dataset('flights')

# Pivot the dataset to a wide-format DataFrame
flights_pivot = flights.pivot("month", "year", "passengers")
Pivot the DataFrame: The DataFrame is pivoted to have months as rows, years as columns, and the number of passengers as values.
# Creating a heatmap

# annot=True: Annotates each cell with the numeric value.
# fmt="d": Specifies that the annotations should be formatted as integers.
# cmap="YlGnBu": Uses the "Yellow-Green-Blue" color map.
sns.heatmap(flights_pivot, annot=True, fmt="d", cmap="YlGnBu")

#   diff between crosstab and heatmap?
#   Functionality:

# crosstab: Focuses on creating a summary table (contingency table) to show the frequency or aggregation of categorical data.
# heatmap: Focuses on visualizing data, particularly matrix-like data, using color gradients.
# Output:

# crosstab: Produces a DataFrame.
# heatmap: Produces a graphical plot.
# Usage Context:

# crosstab: Used for data preparation and summarization.
# heatmap: Used for data visualization.

#   Relationship:
# You often use crosstab to create a summarized DataFrame and then visualize that DataFrame using heatmap.
# The crosstab function helps in structuring and aggregating the data, while the heatmap function helps in visualizing the aggregated data to easily identify patterns.
